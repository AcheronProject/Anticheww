## Introduction

Anticheww is a universal 65% PCB, compatible with TADA68 and KBD67 (rev. 1 was tested and working, not tested with rev. 2 yet) supporting per-key lighting using single-color LEDs, RGB underglow using WS2812C RGB LEDs, rotary encoders and a multitude of layouts:

- Default ANSI bottom row;
- Tsangan bottom row (7.0u spacebar, also known as "simmetrical HHKB")
- Split backspace;
- Split left and right shifts;
- ISO and UK-ISO;
- ABNT and ABNT2 layouts.

Anticheww is an adaptation of the [Tsuki](https://github.com/Gondolindrim/Tsuki).
