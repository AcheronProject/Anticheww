See [this page](https://gondolindrim.github.io/AcheronDocs/anticheww/intro.html) for the Anticheww documentation.

## Introduction

Anticheww was conceived as an experiment on how many layouts one can support in a single PCB. The current (v2.0.8) version is a universal 65% PCB, compatible with TADA68 and KBD67 (rev. 1 was tested and working, not tested with rev. 2 yet) supporting per-key lighting using single-color LEDs, RGB underglow using WS2812C RGB LEDs, rotary encoders and a multitude of layouts:

- Default ANSI bottom row, with and without the 0.5 units blocker;
- 7.0 units spaebar bottom row, with and without 0.5 units blocker;
- 225-125-275 and 275-125-225 split spacebar options;
- Split backspace;
- Split left and right shifts;
- ISO enter;
- ABNT and ABNT2 layouts.
